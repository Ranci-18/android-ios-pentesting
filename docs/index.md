# Android/iOS Testing Process

The Android/iOS pentesting process serves as a guide in every new testing project. It's clarity in mind is, therefore, of utmost importance. 

Here is a generic rundown of the process and what you should be looking for while performing static and dynamic analysis.

## Planning

The planning phase is all about preparation and getting ready to carry forward. This is where you select your target android/iOS application and have a list of vulnerabilities you want to test out beforehand. You can also decide on the set of tools you will use for your testing goals.

## Reconnaissance

With the applicatin to test selected, it is time to do some investigative work on all the ins and outs of the application. Investiaget its infractructure in detail including how the backend works and the APIs it uses to identify all possible entry points. Static analysis aids in your reconnaissance work tremendously.

## Static analysis

Performing static analysis is the start of the actual application pentesting. With the apk format of the application, you can delve into vulnerability scanning in various levels. Here are the things to look out for while performing static analysis:

+ Code review - you look for security vulnerabilities including potential backdoors, insecure libraries, and insecure data handling in the form of hardcoded sensitive data like encryption keys and important app data.

+ Reverse engineering - if the app can be reverse engineered in the first place, that is a vulnerability in of itself. However, successful reverse engineering of the app's binaries means you can reveal sensitive information about the app and how it works.

+ certificates - static analysis also reveals whether the application is signed and uses other relevant certificates to enhance its security. Does the app transfer its data externally in a safe manner using https? Does it make use of authentication and authorization certificates safely communicate with the backend? Certificates are the key to identifying this.

Static analysis reveals a ton of app features concerning how secure it is. This is not an exhaustive list of vunerabilities to scan for in static analysis.

## Dynamic analysis

With a list of vulnerabilities discovered from static analysis, it is time to exploit the weaknesses in dynamic analysis. Run the app in a safe environment and observe how it operates. In addition to the vulnerabilities found, test the app's:

+ Network - look for encryption issues and potential data leaks both internally and externally.

+ Authentication and authorization testing (as discussed in static analysis)

+ Session management - identify how the app handles user sessions and tokens to identify session fixation issues.

+ Data storage testing - look for locally stored application data in addition to poor data encryption, poorly implemented encryption strategies for potential data leakages.

## Report, Remediate and Re-test

With a good understanding of how the application works and having tested and revealed its vulnerabilities both in static and dynamic analysis, it is time to document everything so that the development team can fix the idetified issues. Afteward, re-test the app to ensure the issues were fixed.
